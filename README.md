HTTP requests library for WASM Apps. It provides idiomatic Rust bindings for the `web_sys` `fetch` and `WebSocket` API

This re-exports _all_ the API from [gloo-net](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-net) crate.

### Future plans

- Add framework specific support - e.g. Yew suspense support will be added behind a feature flag.
